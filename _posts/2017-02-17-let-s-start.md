## A New Blog

I've decided to start writing a technical blog.

Why ? Because I'm convinced that by explaining stuff you get better at understanding it. And also because sometimes I cannot find an answer by googling the internet so I could help others.

The blog is hosted on [Github Page](https://pages.github.com/)s and the engine is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This allows me to write in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and focus on the content rather than on the layout. The theme, credited to [Gaohaoyang](https://gaohaoyang.github.io/) was picked up from this [awesome list of Jekyll themes](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes) and took 5 minutes to install (clone, cleanup, push to Github).

I'm also using [prose.io](http://prose.io) to edit in an easy way my posts directly in my browser. I was happy with it since a few days until it just lost the entire content of this first post. Yikes !

I'll try to post here at least once a week.
