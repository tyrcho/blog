## Property Based Testing when preparing for Google Hashcode

This week was the qualification round for [Google Hashcode 2017](https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/).

In order to prepare a bit, I started working on the practice problem : [Slice the Pizza]({{ site.url }}/assets/pizza.pdf).

It involves slicing a pizza in slices small enough, with enough Tomato and Mushrooms in each slice, and getting as much of the pizza in the slices.
